# Chat

A litle chat example made with React and Go

## How to run

In a terminal run (in backend directory)

```bash
go run main.go
```

this will start the websocket server on a 8080 port of localhost, then in a
other terminal window (in frontend directory)

```bash
yarn && yarn start
```

this will start the frontend server on a 3000 port of localhost, open
http://localhost:3000 in multiple browser windows and test
